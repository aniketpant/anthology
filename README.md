=========

Collection of interesting stuff from around the web.

Many a times we miss out on some really cool projects around us and some of them don't even make it to news again for the next few weeks or even months.

This happened to me many times on GitHub and I used to get a hold of these projects from other people's stars. I decided to document these projects so that other's like me don't miss out on all the fun.
